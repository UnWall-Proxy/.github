  <summary>What is UnWall?</summary>

  > UnWall is a browser based VPN/Proxy. Its like 12ft.io (RIP) but its not piracy.. It makes it so it appears you are at the location of the server, allowing you to access content that is only avaliable where the server is!

  <summary>What servers are there?</summary>

  > Currently, there is only one UnWall server- London, England, UK (our devs don't live there. its a cloud server). But you can host your own server, locally at your own house.

  <summary>Why do I need this?</summary>

  > We built this because we wanted to use a VPN but we didn't want to pay or mess around with things like Twingate or Tailscale. We also didn't want to download anything so we made a browser based VPN/Proxy that allows you to browse as if you are in the location of the server, allowing you to access your country's content whilst in others!
